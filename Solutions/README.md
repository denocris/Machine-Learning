# Day One

Everything can be found in the folder 'Linear Regression'. I pushed the exercise of day one in time (5 May morning)
but just yesterday I moved it from Exercises to Solutions and commit it again.

# Day Two

Everything can be found in the folder 'YelpTripAdvisor'. The report, together with the complete exercise can be found
in the jupiter notebook TripAdvisor.ipynb. The other notebooks and scripts were just useful for run the codes on Ulysses.
